<b>What antialiasing methods does G3D support?</b>

FXAA 13 high and low quality are available in G3D::Filmâ€‹ and enabled by default (see the Camera
dialog window)

TAA is available on G3D::Film (see the Camera dialog window). There is a known bug where it
flips the screen upside down in VR, but it works well in other cases. The usual caveats about
TAA apply.

You can create a MSAA framebuffer, but the deferred shading pass doesn't natively support it. I
usually brute force supersample "FSAA" when I want deferred shading with multiple true samples
per pixel, since once you've given up performance it is easier to go that route.

There's also a post-filter radius that you can set in Film which simply blurs by a radial PSF
of that radius. I sometimes set it to 0.5 pixels to really crush aliasing for videos, where
MPEG compression does bad things with aliasing.

Ambient occlusion has its own built-in TAA for denoising.

The rendering passes prefilter normals and materials as well to prevent aliasing before
shading.

Shadow maps use PCF and multi-tap filtering. You can also force variance shadow maps, which
prefilter to avoid aliasing. These have some known light leaking problems. G3D typically uses
them only for shadows from transparent objects.

If you're using the OpenGL RenderDevice, then you can enable OpenGL polygon and line
antialiasing through OpenGL. I don't recommend this because that kind of fixed function
support is disappearing from GPUs and other graphics APIs.
