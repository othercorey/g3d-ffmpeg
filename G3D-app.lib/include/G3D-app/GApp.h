/**
 \brief Optional base class for quickly creating 3D applications.

 GApp has several event handlers implemented as virtual methods.  It invokes these in
 a cooperative, round-robin fashion.  This avoids the need for threads in most
 applications.  The methods are, in order of invocation from GApp::oneFrame:

 <ul>
 <li> GApp::onEvent - invoked once for each G3D::GEvent
 <li> GApp::onAfterEvents - latch any polled state before onUserInput processing
 <li> GApp::onUserInput - process the current state of the keyboard, mouse, and game pads
 <li> GApp::onNetwork - receive network packets; network <i>send</i> occurs wherever it is needed
 <li> GApp::onAI - game logic and NPC AI
 <li> GApp::onSimulation - physical simulation
 <li> GApp::onPose - create arrays of Surface and Surface2D for rendering
 <li> GApp::onWait - tasks to process while waiting for the next frame to start (when there is a refresh limiter)
 <li> GApp::onGraphics - render the Surface and Surface2D arrays.  By default, this invokes two helper methods:
   <ul>
    <li> GApp::onGraphics3D - render the Surface array and any immediate mode 3D
    <li> GApp::onGraphics2D - render the Surface2D array and any immediate mode 2D
   </ul>
 </ul>

 To customize the rendering algorithm without modifying the post-processing
 setup, you can use the default GApp::onGraphics3D and simply
 change the GApp::m_renderer by subclassing G3D::Renderer.

 The GApp::run method starts the main loop.  It invokes GApp::onInit, runs the main loop
 until completion, and then invokes GApp::onCleanup.

 onWait runs before onGraphics because the beginning of onGraphics causes the CPU to block, waiting for the GPU
 to complete the previous frame.

 When you override a method, invoke the GApp version of that method to ensure that Widget%s still work
 properly.  This allows you to control whether your per-app operations occur before or after the Widget ones.

 There are a number of framebuffers:

 - GApp::m_deviceFramebuffer is a pointer to the current display buffer. This is GApp::m_osWindowDeviceFramebuffer when using a monitor and VRApp::m_hmdDeviceFramebuffer for a HMD.
 - GApp::m_osWindowDeviceFramebuffer is the actual buffer of the display. For a monitor this is the "hardware framebuffer" with OpenGL ID 0, which has special support in G3D::Framebuffer.
 - GApp::m_framebuffer, GApp::m_depthPeelFramebuffer, GApp::m_gbuffer point to the framebuffer, depth-peeling framebuffer, and GBuffer that GApp::onGraphics3D should render into. The resolution may vary from m_osWindowHDRFramebuffer for super or sub sampling. This may be rebound between onGraphics3D calls by GApp or subclasses such as VRApp. 
 - GApp::m_osWindowHDRFramebuffer and GApp::m_osWindowGBuffer are a software high dynamic range framebuffer and GBuffer sized for the OSWindow's bounds, plus any guard band padding and scaled by GApp::HDRFramebufferSettings::sampleRateOneDimension. By default, GApp binds GApp::m_framebuffer and GApp::m_gbuffer to these before invoking onGraphics3D.
 - VRApp::m_hmdDeviceFramebuffer is an array of per-eye HMD backing LDR framebuffers (analogous to m_osWindowDeviceFramebuffer)
 - VRApp::m_hmdHDRFramebuffer and VRApp::m_hmdGBuffer are arrays of per-eye (analogous to GApp::m_osWindowHDRFramebuffer and GApp::m_osWindowGBuffer), which VRApp binds m_framebuffer and m_gbuffer for onGraphics3D.

                The use of a guard band allows screen-space effects to avoid boundary cases at the edge of the screen. For example,

                Guard band pixels count against the field of view (this keeps rendering and culling code simpler), so the effective
                field of view observed.

                Note that a 128-pixel guard band at 1920x1080 allocates 40% more pixels than no guard band, so there may be a substantial
                memory overhead to a guard band even though there is little per-pixel rendering cost due to using
