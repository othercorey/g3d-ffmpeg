/** \brief Application framework for HMD Virtual Reality programs on HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Oculus DK2.

    Use the tab key to toggle seeing the GUI in the HMD.
    
    For many programs, simply changing from inheriting your App from GApp to VRApp will immediately
    add HMD support. You must have the OpenVR Runtime (AKA SteamVR) installed to use VRApp. OpenVR is 
    a free download as part of (Steam)[https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe], which
    is also free download for multiple platforms.
    
    You do *not* need to install the Oculus, SteamVR, or OpenVR SDKs--G3D includes the files that you need.

    There are several MarkerEntity and reference frames at play for VR in order to attempt to model
    the degrees of freedom for a tracked HMD while still minimizing the amount of code needed to make
    a non-VR GApp subclass run as a VRGApp subclass. This API is in a very early state and subject to 
    continous change.

    The reference frames are:
- World
  - "XR Tracked Volume" [physical room. Can be changed by teleportation/explicit simulation based motion]
    - "XR Head" [determined by tracking]
      - "XR Left Eye" [fixed for each device]
      - "XR Right Eye" [fixed for each device]
    - Other "XR Tracked Object"s [determined by tracking]

Beware that this has some important implications:
 - If you want a body frame, it must be inferred from the hands & head (or itself tracked with a separate real-world object)
 - There is nothing inherent in the scene graph constraining the head and hands to have a plausible distance relationship. App-specific logic must enforce those constraints.
 - The "default camera" from a non-VR scene becomes the default TrackedVolume coordinate frame. It does not become the head.
 - The TrackedVolume must be moved vertically in world space based on the userâ€™s height and standing/seating status
 - Movement of the TrackedVolume must be constrained by physics & collisions with geometry attached to the head frame in the world (not based on the TrackedVolume itself)


 Supports the following extra fields on G3D::Scene in a data file for automatically adding
 G3D::VisibleEntity instances with appropriate geometry that track the relevant MarkerEntity
 created by XRWidget:

 ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````
 vr = {
    avatar = {
        addHandEntity = true;
        addControllerEntity = true;
        addTorsoEntity = true;
    }
 }
